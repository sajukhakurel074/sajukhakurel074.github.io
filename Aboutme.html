            I am an Embedded System Engineer-Vehicle Software, at <a href="https://yatrimotorcycles.com/">Yatri Motorcycles </a>.

            I received my Bachelor degree in Electronics and 
            Communication Engineering from the Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University. I am seeking a 
            research assistant position to work on embedded and computer science.<br>
            During my college days, I was a member of <a href="https://robotics.pcampus.edu.np/">Robotics Club </a> in my college. Joining this 
            club helped me boost my confidence along with accelerating my skills in multiple fields. 
            <br>
            Besides, I am also a decent basketball player and have played in multiple tournaments during my college days. Additionally, I 
            enjoy doing free writtings, paintings and reading novels.
